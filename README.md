# Diary

## Overview
A Diary website created using Flask (Python), HTML, Bootstrap (CSS), and a hint of Javascript. The premise is that a user creates an account to post diary entries which they can delete at any point and logout so their entry is secured. This website is still in its infancy and is continuously being worked on.
